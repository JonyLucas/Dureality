# Dureality
Dureality is a platform game, where you play as two monks that have to restore their inner balance.
The monks have inverse controls, so when you go left with one, the other one will go right.
You have to restore the balance by collecting the parts of the yin yang symbol in the level, so when you got all of the parts, both of the monks have to meet at commom sport, where both can arrive.
The game was made as part of the Global game jam and can be played on https://jonylucas.itch.io/dureality
